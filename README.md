Cumcord is a Discord client mod that focuses on making the Discord plugin development experience
easier.

# Features

- Cumcord can run as a plugin for other mods (BetterDiscord, Powercord, GooseMod, etc), so you only
  have to write plugins once - [write once, run anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WORE)!
- Sperm can create "helper" plugins for other mods that make the experience of installing a Cumcord
  plugin the same as installing one for the end-user's host mod
- Cumcord plugins have no access to NodeJS for better security and web support (!!!)
- Cumcord plugins are bundled with Rollup and are capable of using `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`,
  `.scss`, `.sass` files and BROWSER SUPPORTING npm packages with no developer config
- Cumcord includes utils for Discord tasks that don't exist in Discord's own modules
<!-- - Cumcord includes event handlers that will assist you in proxying multiple things (message
  creations, message deletions, message edits, profile updates, etc) -->
- All Cumcord plugins are loaded via HTTP(S) and have no reliance on Git.
